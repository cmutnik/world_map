# Photo Map of Hawaii

All images used here were taken by the owner of this repository.  Original copies of the images have been removed to save space.  [Thumbnails](./photos/thumbnails/) have been included, so this map can easily be recreated.

The script [`make_HI_photo_map.py`](./make_HI_photo_map.py) was used to generate the html map, [`HI_photo_map.html`](./HI_photo_map.html).  The map starts over the Hawaiian Island Archipelago.
